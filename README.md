## Test Coverage and Continuous Integration (CI)
[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) was used to test our code coverage for the API during this project.  
[Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) was used to test our code's Cypress test coverage for the Client side of the project.  
Continuous integration was handled using [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/).
